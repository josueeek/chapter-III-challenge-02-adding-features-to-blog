## üìö Project information

* This blog was a project developed during a Rocketseat Ignite Challenge! The idea was to develop an application from 0, from the front-end to the connection with Prismic CMS for the publication of posts.

&nbsp;

## üíª What's in the project?

* Very clean front-end, developed as proposed in the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0Y26j0tf1K2WB5c1ja5hov/Desafios-M%C3%B3dulo-3-ReactJS?node-id=0%3A1).
* Integration with Prismic CMS, to work with every part of the blog system.
* Integration with Prismic's Preview system, where you can see an unpublished post inside the blog, even before it goes live.
* Use of Next.js static system, where posts are cached for better loading.
* Comment system using Utteranc.
